
1.0-beta2
=========
- FnMathOfX methods are no longer static.
- org.op4j.target.ExecCtxImpl is now public and was moved to org.op4j.util.ExecCtxImpl.
- Created org.op4j.util.ValuePair in order to support Binary Operation Functions.
- Created "reduce" actions for arrays, lists, and sets.
- Created "FnReduce" function class with functions ready to be used in "reduce" operations.
- Created unfold functions and actions for generic unique operators.
- Added aggregation functions in FnMath for arrays.
- Improved precision management in FnMath functions
- Added "negate" function to FnBoolean.
- All predefined op4j functions now extend Function and thus provide an "execute" method
  without context which allows them to be executed on their own more easily.
- Added utility methods to Fn like "Fn.onString()" to avoid having to specify the type as
  "Fn.on(Types.STRING)".
- Added "eq" (equality) and "notEq" (not equality) function to FnObject, FnNumber, 
  FnBoolean, FnString, FnCalendar, FnDate.
- Added "eqBy" and "notEqBy" to FnObject, FnNumber and FnBoolean.
- Added "sortBy" functions to FnArray, FnList, FnMap and FnSet. Added "sortBy" actions to
  array, list, map and set operators. 
- Added "lessThan", "lessOrEqTo", "greaterThan" and "greaterOrEqTo" functions to 
  FnObject, FnNumber and FnString.
- Added "lessThanBy", "lessOrEqToBy", "greaterThanBy", "greaterOrEqToBy" to FnObject and FnNumber.
- Added "and", "or" and "not" functions to FnBoolean and Fn.
- Added "isNull" and "isNotNull" functions to FnObject, FnNumber, FnBoolean, FnString, FnCalendar,
  FnDate.
- Added "chain" function to "Fn".
- Added "count" function to FnArray, FnList, FnMap and FnSet
- Added "contains", "notContains, "containsAll", "containsAny" and "containsNone" to 
  FnArray, FnList and FnSet.
- Added "containsKey", "notContainsKey", "containsAllKeys", "containsAnyKeys" and 
  "containsNoneKeys" to FnMap.
- Added "by" function to Fn and FnBoolean.
- Added "isNullBy" and "isNotNullBy" to FnBoolean and FnObject
- Added "ifTrue", "ifFalse", "ifNull", "ifNotNull", "ifNullOrTrue", "ifNullOrFalse",
  "ifNotNullAndTrue" and "ifNotNulAndFalse" functions to Fn.
- Added "whileTrue" and "whileFalse" functions to Fn.
- Cast methods "asArrayOf", "asListOf", "asMapOf" and "asSetOf" in array, list, map and set
  operators renamed to "of" and created "castToArrayOf", "castToListOf", "castToMapOf" and
  "castToSetOf" aliases. "asType" methods renamed to "castTo".
- Multi generic operators removed.
- Added "onArrayFor", "onListFor" and "onSetFor" methods to Op in order to build structures 
  from their elements.
- Added "onMapFor" to Op returning a new class of map operator: "Building map operator". This allows
  the building of maps with successive calls to the "and" method after the "onMapFor" call. This
  "and" method will dissapear after any other method is called.
- Renamed "toMapByKeyEval" to "zipKeysBy", and added "zipValuesBy", "zipKeys" and "zipValues".
- Renamed "toMapByAlternateElements" to "couple", and added "coupleAndGroup".
