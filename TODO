
  - Add a way to create a map from an array/list/set by specifying TWO functions instead of one.
  - FnString.isNumeric or FnString.isInteger(), isFloat() or similar...
  - Maybe create a class containing methods, specific for static importing. Or maybe recommend
    the static import of "Call", which would require the renaming of its methods...
