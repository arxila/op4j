
  - Why do key an value operators have "ifIndex"?
  - Check the possibility of removing the ofX() step from FnMath
  - Add method to create maps from arrays, lists and sets considering them values/keys and zipping
    keys/values. Maybe think about renaming current "toMapByX" methods.
  - Add "partition" method to FnArray, FnList, FnMap, FnSet.
