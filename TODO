
 - Add "getSimpleName" to javaruntype types so that package can be omitted
 - Add "getUpperBounds/getUniqueUpperBound" + Lower to javaruntype "Types"

 - Check the usage of all Type parameters. Would they be fooled with something like 
   Type<List<? extends Object>>?
    
 - Create some sort of  "replace" method
 - Should the "add" of arrays have the same name as the "add" of generic operators? (they work on different dimensions!)
 - WARNING: Op.buildListOfList(Types.STRING).add(listOfString1).add(listOfString2).get()
