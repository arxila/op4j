
  - Why do key an value operators have "ifIndex"?
  - Check if adding "Fn.by(IFunction, IFunction)" is possible
  - Add "by" versions to comparators: eq, notEq, lessThan, null, isNull, etc. (if needed)
  - Check the possibility of removing the ofX() step from FnMath
  - Add method to create maps from arrays, lists and sets considering them values/keys and zipping
    keys/values.
